    <ul><h4>Colin H </h4>- Swat is a good show but there is just way too much of it about the colour of people's skin to the point of obsession with this as a story line</ul>
    <ul><h4>Anonymous </h4>- If you have an issue with a TV show focusing on issues that are very prominent in the world that we live in then YOU are the problem. This season did an amazing job of showing that, although there are bad police officers, we also have great ones. It focused on more of the BLM issues witch I respect but I would have liked if it also would have had more of a COVID approach too.</ul>
    <ul><h4>Philip S </h4>- SWAT in season 4 makes the error of hoisting a flag and challenging the viewer to switch off. Characters are just mouthpieces for the writers to give speeches...literally sitting and giving a lecture.</ul>
