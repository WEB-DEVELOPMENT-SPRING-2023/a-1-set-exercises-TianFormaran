    The series centers on Los Angeles 
        Police Department Sergeant Daniel "Hondo" Harrelson. A lifelong Los Angeles local 
        and former Marine, Hondo has been tapped to lead a new "last stop" Special Weapons 
        and Tactics unit of the LAPD. Because he is both black and L.A. born and raised, 
        Hondo feels deeply loyal not only to his "brothers in blue" but also to the people 
        they serve.
