     <h1>Home Cooked Filipino Adobo</h1>
<body>
    <!--This explains the origin of adobo-->
    <p>Adobo or adobar (Spanish: marinade, sauce, or seasoning) is the immersion 
        of cooked food in a stock (or sauce) composed variously of paprika, oregano, 
        salt, garlic, and vinegar to preserve and enhance its flavor. The Portuguese 
        variant is known as Carne de vinha d'alhos. The practice, native to Iberia 
        (Spanish cuisine and Portuguese cuisine), was widely adopted in Latin America, 
        as well as Spanish and Portuguese colonies in Africa and Asia.</p>

        <p>In the Philippines, the name adobo was given by colonial-era Spaniards on the islands 
        to a different indigenous cooking method that also uses vinegar. Although similar, 
        this developed independently of Spanish influence.</p>

        <p>Philippine adobo  is a popular Filipino dish and cooking process in Philippine 
           cuisine that involves meat, seafood, or vegetables marinated in vinegar, soy sauce, 
           garlic, bay leaves, and black peppercorns, which is browned in oil, and simmered in 
           the marinade. It has occasionally been considered the unofficial national dish in 
           the Philippines.</p>
